# IslandGenerator
Used Perln noise to get the height map.
Added octaves, persistance, and lacunarity variables
Added offset and seed option
Added Colour based on noise map height variables
Created a Mesh version of the colour map.

ToDo:

Use Fall off maps to create island structure
Use the height map to change mesh shape
Add ability to spawn foliage and animals
Maybe create natural water pathways from the mountain
Add more information to each cell, such as "walkable", "drinkable", "suitableForFoliage", etc
Add 'Animals' or other simulated creatures, maybe use Evolutionary agents or Neural Networks or Reinforcement learning
