# IslandGenerator
Used Perln noise to get the height map.
Used Fall off maps to create island structure
Use the resulting noise values to specify some of the cell types

ToDo:

Add more height to the model as it's currently only 2D
Add ability to spawn foliage and animals
Maybe create natural water pathways from the mountain
Add more information to each cell, such as "walkable", "drinkable", "suitableForFoliage", etc
Add 'Animals' or other simulated creatures, maybe use Evolutionary agents or Neural Networks or Reinforcement learning
